JETechF11-12Extension

I bought a cheap keyboard which didn't have F11 or F12 (probably because of the way the scancodes are layed out - F11 and F12 are significantly different than F1-10, so I can see how, for a cheap keyboard such as this, they did not include those keys as it would take extra effort), and this script fixes that. It allows you to use Shift+F1 as F11, and Shift+F2 as F12.
